# Logistic Regression for Advertisement Click Prediction

In this project, we explore a fictitious advertising dataset to develop a logistic regression model that predicts whether a particular internet user will click on an advertisement based on various user features. The dataset provides valuable insights into user behavior and the effectiveness of advertising campaigns.

## Dataset Overview

The dataset contains the following features:

- **Daily Time Spent on Site**: The amount of time the consumer spends on the website in minutes.
- **Age**: The age of the customer in years.
- **Area Income**: The average income of the geographical area where the consumer resides.
- **Daily Internet Usage**: The average number of minutes per day the consumer spends on the internet.
- **Ad Topic Line**: The headline or topic of the advertisement.
- **City**: The city of the consumer.
- **Male**: A binary variable indicating whether the consumer is male (1) or not (0).
- **Country**: The country of the consumer.
- **Timestamp**: The time at which the consumer clicked on the ad or closed the window.
- **Clicked on Ad**: A binary target variable, with 0 indicating that the user did not click on the ad, and 1 indicating that they did.

## Project Goals

The main objectives of this project are as follows:

1. **Data Exploration**: We will begin by exploring and visualizing the dataset to gain a deeper understanding of the data and its distributions.

2. **Data Preprocessing**: Data preprocessing steps may include handling missing values, encoding categorical features, and splitting the data into training and testing sets.

3. **Feature Selection**: Identifying the most relevant features for the prediction task is crucial. We may employ feature selection techniques to improve model performance.

4. **Logistic Regression Model**: We will build a logistic regression model to predict whether a user will click on the advertisement based on the user's features.

5. **Model Evaluation**: The model's performance will be evaluated using various metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, and the F1-score. We will also visualize the model's performance using a confusion matrix.
